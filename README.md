# Dagger

Dagger is an engine that lets you create devops pipelines as regular code running in regular containers, rather than proprietary YAML running on a proprietary CI/CD platform.

A Dagger pipeline may be used to build, test, deploy, lint, scan, sign, transform, notify... or perhaps all of the above!

Popular features include:

* SDKs for (almost) all major languages
* Run pipelines from your existing tools, instead of learning yet another CLI
* Drop to GraphQL for complete control over your pipelines
* Faster builds with automatic caching of every step
* Pipelines run in regular containers, making them very portable
* The same pipelines can run in development and CI
* Share and reuse custom pipeline steps using extensions
